# Welcome to Webdev & Friends, a place to collaborate together!

## Goal 🏆
Provide a space for developers of all skill levels to come together and work on projects.

## Vision 👁️
Sometimes it can be difficult and scary to find other people to work on a project with, whether it be for practice, to try a new technology, or to bring a great idea to life! We want to provide an environment where developers of all skill levels can work together on projects of their own or to contribute to a project that is already in the works.

## Start collaborating 🧑‍💻
1. Ask one of our organization owners to join [blue2wo](https://github.com/blue2wo) / [Evomatic](https://github.com/Evomatic)
2. Once you have access create a project of your own and start collaborating, or find a project to join!
